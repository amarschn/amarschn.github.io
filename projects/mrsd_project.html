  <h1>MRSD Project</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  This was a year-long team project I worked on with 3 other members during my first year at CMU. The project premise was an easily re-configurable, modular robotic system. I learned a lot from this project, as it was the first time I built a complex robot. Overall I think the project was a great learning success, although the system was not as reliable as I would have liked. Below are the updates I wrote up for the 2 semesters.
