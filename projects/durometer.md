Automated Durometer:
====================

The files for this project are located in a different repository, which can be found [here] (https://github.com/amarschn/Durometer_Assembly). The top-level assembly is called 'Durometer_Assembly' and can be downloaded in STP format if necessary.

This was a brief project I worked on over Christmas of 2014. The goal was to automate a durometer (device for measuring hardness of different materials, in this case different kinds of rubber) for a scientific devices manufacturer.

I did this project in Autodesk Inventor, as I wanted to try it out to see what all of the fuss was about. Once again, being a parametric CAD program it wasn't too different from Solidworks or Pro-E. The usual sketch/extrude/repeat process was mostly the same. My other focus was off-the-shelf material, as I did not have access to any kind of fabrication facilities during the majority of the break and so had to work with whatever I could get. McMaster was (once again) a godsend for this project.

In automating the durometer, I decided to implement a stepper-motor/lead screw system for raising and lowering the durometer. Steppers are relatively cheap and combined with lead screws allow for very accurate motion control, and no power draw during inactivity.

This project is currently on hiatus due to school taking up the majority of my time, but I was able to build a working prototype before the end of the break. Unfortunately I cannot find a video of it operating, but I will post that once I find it!
