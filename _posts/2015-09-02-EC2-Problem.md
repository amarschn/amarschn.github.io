So today I tried to get started with hosting the ecosystem on an AWS EC2 instance. Unfortunately the memory limits of the free tier of EC2 (1 GiB or ~1 GB) prevent me from installing the Julia packages I need! So I am either going to have to find a way around this or find another free web hosting solution. An annoying setback that makes me wonder whether Julia was the right language for this in the first place.
