IT'S ALIVE!!!!!!

A lot has happened since my last post, but finally I got the ecosystem to run correctly. There were many small errors to fix and I had to sacrifice on some of my initial desires of how creatures would work. Here is a screencap of a 100 x 100 ecosystem on around the 14,000th run-through of the grid:

As you can see, it is primarily green with some darker areas and some brown as well. The colors correspond to the following:

- Red - FEAR : how much the creature wants to stay alive
- Green - GREED : how much the creature wants energy
- Blue - SOCIAL : how much the creature wants to be near similar creatures

As time went on, it became clear that greed dominated, as the field became greener and greener:
