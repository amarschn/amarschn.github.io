	01/01/2014 Day 1: Hello World!
	</p>
	<p>
	Hello, my name is Drew, and I am developing a game, tentatively named Star Block.
	</p>
	<p>
	Star Block will be a 2D space-shooter/spaceship-building game. Kind of like a mix between Asteroids and a 2D version of Minecraft. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The main purpose of this blog will be to act as a development journal, something that will help motivate me when the game inevitably loses it's new project luster, and allow me to look back at my thought processes during development. I also have never set up a blog or website before, so I thought this would be a way to learn about web development. As of right now I am using Github Pages and have not yet gotten a domain name.
	</p>
	<p>
	A bit about the game so far:
	</p>
	<p>
	I am using the multi-platform, open source framework <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a> which I chose largely due to it's large user base, active development, use of Java (I like Java), and because I was tired of constantly jumping from framework to framework wondering which the "best" was.
	</p>
	<p>
	The game is focused around the idea of making 2D spaceships out of different types of squares, and using that ship to battle enemy spaceships. Right now the types of squares with which the player can build their ship are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Command Squares: the heart of the ship, lose this and your ship is toast</li>
		<li>Energy Squares: these squares power the engines and weapons of the ship</li>
		<li>Engine Squares: allow the ship to move</li>
		<li>Weapon Squares: cannons, missiles, lasers</li>
		<li>Storage Squares: store ammunition and fuel</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	What I like about this mechanic is that it forces the player to consider the design of their ship with their playing style, and immediately offers a kind of balance between size, speed, manueverability, durability, and firepower. Another cool aspect of this is that the functionality of your ship will change as you fight, for instance when an energy square on your ship is destroyed, all of the weapons and engines that energy square may have powered will become dead weight.
	</p>
	<p>
	I plan on posting once a day about my development progress. I have set myself a 60 day goal of having a completed PC game. In my case completed means the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ship construction and modification</li>
		<li>Movement and combat using the previously mentioned "powered squares" game mechanics</li>
		<li>At least 1 playable mission</li>
		<li>PC only</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	These are admittedly pretty modest goals, but I have never developed a full game before and I don't think it is a good idea to set unattainable milestones. With that being said, I do plan on making this game cross platform, with the next target (after PC) being Android. For now though, I will focus on the PC as my sole platform.
